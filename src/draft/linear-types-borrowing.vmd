What Vale Taught Us About Linear Types and Borrowing




one of the best benefits of using a new language is seeing new ways of thinking.

i mostly design vale, but sometimes, it designs itself.

talk about how we dont need borrow checkers or GC or RC for memory safety. we just need one thing: single ownership.

single ownership first came from c++ blah blah blah

only need a couple constructs: swap, destructure
