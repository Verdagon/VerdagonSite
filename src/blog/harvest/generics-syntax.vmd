two possibilities:

if we use [],
- we can still have seqs. when theres no identifier before it, its a seq.
- ambiguity with indexing. `arr[x]` might be:
  - index local "arr" with local "x"
  - generic type "arr" specialized with type "x"
  - referencing function arr

languages get around this:
- for declarations:
  - go, and scala both use ":" in their declarations
  - C# looks for the =
- for binary operators, it's moot, [ and ] arent binary operators.
- calling generic functions:
  - go: myfunc[int](blah)
  - scala: myfunc[int](blah)
  - c#: not sure what they do here? moo<3>(5)
- for making a new array:
  - go requires saying [x]arr instead.
  - scala uses new, or puts it behind a function. it uses new in the end.
  - C# uses new
- for making a new instance of a generic type
  - go requires {} afterward like Bunch[int]{1, 2, 3}
  - scala uses new, or puts it behind a function. it uses new in the end.
  - C# uses new


if we use <>
- we can still have seqs. when theres no identifier before it, its a seq.
- ambiguity with less than and greater than. `arr<x> y;` might be:
  - (arr < x) > y
  - declare y of type arr<x>.
  - calling generic function arr<x>
  - making a new instance of type arr<x>

languages get around this:
- to do declaration
  - rust requires : in its declarations.
  - vale looks for the =, everything to the left is a definition.
  - java requires new
- to do binary operators (like `arr < x > y`),
  - rust requires ::<> for calls, so otherwise its binary ops
  - vale requires no space before or no space after
  - java requires new
- calling generic function
  - rust requires ::<> for calls
  - vale uses spacing
  - java i think requires ThisClass.<params here> for this.
- to make a new array:
  - rust: let array: [i32; 3] = [0; 3];
  - vale: it's a regular type.
  - java: new keyword.
- make new instance of type arr<x>
  - rust requires braces, i think
  - vale treats it like a generic function.
  - java uses the new keyword.

C++/java/swift/rust vastly outweigh C#/scala/go/nim.
the statically typed language taught in schools is java.
so, go with familiarity. for ease, require new, or do spacing.


spacing isnt bad, because we do it all the time.
- `func myFunction(a: i64) -> i64 { ... }` has a space between `fn` and `myFunction`
- `a and b` needs a space before and after `and`. same with `is`, `or`, etc.
- `not a`
- `void main`, `int x`
- `let myThing`
- `return x`
- `is` and `as` in swift and rust
- C#, linq: IEnumerable<int> highScoresQuery = from score in scores where score > 80 orderby score descending select score;

literally any keyword requires spaces.



java 11.4
typescript 7.5
c++ 6.94
kotlin 0.71
swift 0.7
rust 0.92
= 28.17

go 8.82
c# 3.72
scala 1.55
= 14.09

literally 2x use <> lol



vale uses semicolons and =, but thats not necessary. can look for `let` and `:`

Pair[5] can be to call a constructor
maybe we can say you can never have something before the [
like its gotta be [5]
