autovalue, then scala case classes, are amazing and every language
should have them.

i think functional languages might have them too and call them value
classes or value types

perhaps mention where \*not\* to use them. talk about how functional
programming is nice and we're giving people more of a spectrum to work
with instead of two extremes.
