Goal: show them how consistent single ownership unlocked amazing things.
Inspire them to do even more with it!

Casually mention how Vale takes single ownership even further than Rust
and C++.

Show them how all of Vale\'s innovations\...

-   Faster RC:

    -   Can even compile it out

    -   Better branch prediction!

-   Regions (specifically, secession), and thus:

    -   Bump calling

    -   Arena calling

    -   Cross-compiling

        -   Native calling

\...were made possible by single ownership.
