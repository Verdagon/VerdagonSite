in the near future, v will produce adequate results, hopefully at least
half as good as hand-coded things. thats the java to c comparison.

at first we\'ll only support the common and basic case, like mysql,
firebase, aws.

eventually, things will happen:

\- people will make their servers and databases speak superstructures
somewhat well, with annotations and whatnot. we\'ll make the ddl
extensible enough, and the bytecode understandable enough.

\- people will use the superstructure model natively! just as everyone
speaks sql now, we\'ll have a better way of expressing them in our ss
funcs. databases will eventually understand immutables and the queries
to find all those referencing me.
