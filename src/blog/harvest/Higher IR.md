talk about all the benefits of having built in string, flatmap, map,
filter, fold, list, map, and set, with hints on how theyll be used.

talk about how it lets different backends represent them differently.
for example, linked lists make no sense on firebase. vectors make more
sense on CPUs.

and hopefully by then we\'ll have lots of examples of amazing
optimizations we can do, since the optimizer knows about flatmap, map,
filter, fold. (for example, knowing things are unique)
