I often like to hide a little "easter egg" note in the side notes, and see if anyone finds them before I remove them.


There are *two* outstanding easter egg notes that nobody has found.


Below is a list of past easter egg notes, enjoy!


Also, if you have any ideas for future easter egg notes, let me know! You can reach me via [email](mailto:verdagon_epsa@verdagon.dev), [twitter](https://twitter.com/vale_pl), or [discord](https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH). Cheers!

# William "Billy" Windsor I

(Was on [Borrow checking, RC, GC, and the Eleven (!) Other Memory Safety Approaches](/grimoire/grimoire#more-in-the-grimoire))

[William "Billy" Windsor I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Windsor_%28goat%29) is a [cashmere goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere_goat) who served as lance corporal in the British Army's [Royal Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Welsh) 1st Battalion from 2001 until 2009.

He was demoted to rank [fusilier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusilier) for three months for inappropriate behaviour during the 2006 [Queen's Official Birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Official_Birthday) celebrations while on active duty with the battalion on Cyprus.

If you read this note, mention "that one lance corporal goat" anywhere on HN or reddit! [Nobody will believe you](https://youtu.be/-UBgNREvlIo).

# Brigadier Sir Nils Olav III

(Was on [Vale's First Prototype for Immutable Region Borrowing](https://web.archive.org/web/20230712155756/https://verdagon.dev/blog/first-regions-prototype#where-does-vale-go-from-here))


[Brigadier Sir Nils Olav III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Olav), colonel-in-chief of the Norwegian King's Guard, is a widely celebrated national hero. A statue was erected in his honor in 2005, and he was even awarded a knighthood by [King Harald V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_V_of_Norway) himself.

Oh also, Nils Olav is a [king penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_penguin).

During his knighting ceremony, the King declared that Nils was, as a penguin, "in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood".

# G. I. Joe

(Was on [Making C++ Memory-Safe Without Borrow Checking, RC, or GC](https://web.archive.org/web/20230629052606/https://verdagon.dev/blog/vale-memory-safe-cpp#borrowless-affine-style))


A pigeon named [G. I. Joe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe_%28pigeon%29) was awarded the [Dickin Medal for gallantry](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do/animal-awards-programme/pdsa-dickin-medal) for saving the British 56th infantry division and the inhabitants of Calvi Vecchia, Italy.

G. I. Joe successfully flew a last-resort message to the nearby allied artillery to cancel bombarding the city, which the infantry had just successfully taken over. [o7](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=o7), you brave bird!
