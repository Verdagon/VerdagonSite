Currently, the general consensus is that *you can't really run larger LLMs* on ordinary computers. [# You generally either get an out-of-memory error or it runs way too slowly.]


But now, you can run an LLM much larger than your VRAM to *answer a yes/no question every 5 seconds* on average, for throughput use cases. [# This means cases where latency doesn't matter, where you're fine waiting a while to get a result.]


This is possible with *batching and layer-wise inferencing* from disk, where we stream an LLM's layers from the hard drive into VRAM, and run each layer against multiple in-progress prompts before moving on to the next layer.


<ignore>
For example, for a 68-gigabyte 34B LLM, instead of answering one question in 35.354 seconds using layer-wise inferencing alone, batching makes it answer 500 questions in 2426 seconds, averaging 4.85 seconds per question.

For fun, I spent an evening prototyping this into an [AirLLM fork](https://github.com/Verdagon/Anima/commit/d90e07756014bd174c172fa3bf57a3770e3842a0). [# Just Mac currently, sorry!]


Of course, this isn't a new technique! [Moritz Thüning](https://github.com/moritztng) used this technique months ago in their [fltr](https://github.com/moritztng/fltr) tool, which is like grep but for natural language questions: ask it a human question and it will run that question against many documents at once. And even before that, [Sheng et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06865) wrote a paper about the technique and published their code as [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen), though unfortunately for me, it doesn't support Macs.


Read on to hear the nonsense that led to this, or feel free to skip to the [technical stuff](#layer-wise-inferencing)!



# Background: The Flora-bama Mullet Toss


In 1985, an unknown man threw a fish from the beaches of Florida all the way into Alabama. To some, this became known as "the greatest fish-based artillery assault of the 80s." [# "Some" being me and a few of my buddies from the discord server.] To the Alabamans, it probably became known as the "fish heard 'round the world", [# A reference to the [shot heard round the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_heard_round_the_world)] and confirmation of Florida's ambitions of conquest.


Now, every April, Floridians and Alabamans flock to the Perdido Key beaches to reenact that glorious toss, in a charity event where they compete to see who can throw a fish the furthest into Alabama.


It is unknown whether anyone has beaten the record set back then, and it is unknown whether this will escalate into more advanced munitions in coming years like [rubber fish](https://www.peta.org/blog/flora-bama-mullet-toss/), which are more aerodynamic and pack a lot more kinetic energy.


When I heard about the [Florabama Mullet Toss](https://www.florabama.com/mullet-toss), I knew I _had to_ find more weird events like this. Surely, there must be more!


This is actually something *LLMs are good at*: crawling the web and interpreting webpages.


## The "Weird Event Finder"

So I made a little tool which basically *asks ChatGPT and doublechecks via Google*, basically a poor-man's [retrieval-augmented generation](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/) approach:

 * I type in a question, like "What are the most weird, interesting, obscure yearly events that happen in North Carolina?" [# Or other fun ones like "What are the weirdest annual llama-related events in the United States?"]
 * It feeds that to ChatGPT (which returns more hallucinations than actual events) which responds a CSV "possible event list" including name, city, state.
 * *For each possible event,* it:
    * Does a google search with the name, city, and state of the event, like: "Pirate Invasion Beaufort North Carolina".
    * *For each google result,* such as [thebeaufortpirateinvasion.com](https://www.thebeaufortpirateinvasion.com/) it:
       * Gives the page text to ChatGPT and asks it, "Is this page describing an event?". If no, skip.
       * It *asks it questions* like:
          * "Is this page describing one event, multiple events, or no events at all?"
          * "What's the event's name?"
          * "Does the event repeat every year?"

It then takes the resulting list of event pages, and puts them on a webpage to ask me if they're weird enough and look legit.


However, *this was very expensive.* Even with various optimizations, I was racking up $10 per night in OpenAI spending. And this was just a tiny weekend side-project, so it would be hard to justify spending *thousands of dollars* on GPUs to run models locally.


It was unfortunate that my Macbook Pro only had 16gb of RAM, otherwise I could run an LLM locally. Alas, I would need _much_ more RAM to run a 70B LLM, [# A Q5-quantized 70B model would need 60gb of RAM, and Mac OS needs a lot of RAM for the OS, so we're talking a 64gb or 128gb Macbook Pro.] and the smaller LLMs just don't work as well.


# Layer-wise Inferencing

It's clear that I need more RAM so I can run an LLM locally.

...or do I?


Recently, tools like lyogavin's [AirLLM](https://github.com/lyogavin/Anima/tree/main/air_llm) (and others) have emerged, which allow us to *run an LLM piece-by-piece*.

Why load the entire huge model into VRAM, when we're only using a piece of it at a time? Let's just load whatever piece we need right now!


Basically, *an LLM is divided into layers*.

For example, The 68-gigabyte model [UNA-SimpleSmaug-34b-v1beta](https://huggingface.co/fblgit/UNA-SimpleSmaug-34b-v1beta) is actually 59 layers of 1.12 gigabytes each. 

AirLLM does *layer-wise inferencing*: it loads one layer into VRAM, runs it, unloads it, and repeats, feeding each layer's "in-progress thought" tensor [#tensor] into the next.

You could almost think of it as *streaming layers into VRAM* on-demand, and then quickly unloading to make room for the next layer.

! Well, not technically VRAM. More recent Macs' Ram is actually [unified memory](https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-silicon-unified-memory/) which is directly accessible to the CPU, GPU, and the neural engine. But that shouldn't matter much here, these techniques should apply to any GPU setup.


A metaphor would be how your average steampunk chap-hop rapper scientist gets through his day:

 * First, he puts on his time-traveling trousers and grabs tea leaves from his favorite victorian-era tea shop.
 * Then, he puts on his tea trousers, which let him turn the leaves into the finest tea possible.
 * Then, he puts on his [fighting trousers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iRTB-FTMdk) to turn the caffeine into a new diss track about Mr. B, a rival steampunk chap-hop rapper.

[Professor Elemental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Elemental) doesn't wear all three trousers at once, _and neither should we._


<slice>
#tensor: You can think of a "tensor" as a block of numbers, or rather, an N-dimensional array of numbers. An N=1 tensor is a regular array, an N=5 tensor is a 5d array, and an N=0 tensor is just a single number.

Here, each layer produces a block of numbers that is fed into the next layer. You can kind of think of it as an "in-progress thought".
</slice>

# ...is really slow

Layer-wise inferencing makes it _possible_ to run large models, but not very _desirable_ to do so.

If a "token" is a word, then the average human can speak 100-150 tokens per minute, and ChatGPT speaks about [6000](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/15nig1k/did_someone_calculate_how_fast_gpt35_is_in_terms/) tokens per minute.

AirLLM gives us... 2 tokens per minute. Very slow indeed.


...which makes sense, really. It needs to load 59 layers from RAM for every single token. [# You'd be slow too if you had to cycle through 59 trousers every time you wanted to say a word.]


Even for my use case, that's a bit too slow. Even if I only used AirLLM for only the yes-or-no questions (like "Does this event happen every year?"), it would only be able to doublecheck one possible event every 42 minutes. [# 30 seconds x 7 search results x 12 questions per result = 42 minutes.]


This is roughly the consensus today: *you can't really run large models on regular computers,* it's just too slow.


# We can speed it up!

"Batching" is a well-known strategy, for various other use cases.

For example, one could load a 68-gigabyte model onto three RTX A5000s (each has 24gb memory), and do inferencing on multiple prompts at a time, using llama.cpp's --parallel flag or HuggingFace's Accelerate's `batch_size` parameter.

It's also common practice to use batching when training a model, for example DeepSpeed's [train_batch_size](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/) parameter.


However, those require that the entire model be loaded, into this machine's memory or distributed in other machines' memory. We only have one machine with relatively little VRAM.


So, it seemed I had a few options:

 * Add Mac support to [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen).
 * Add layer-wise inferencing to llama.cpp.
 * Add batching to [AirLLM](https://github.com/lyogavin/Anima/tree/main/air_llm).


The last one definitely sounded the easiest.


# Success!

In the end, it only took [123 lines](https://github.com/Verdagon/Anima/commit/d90e07756014bd174c172fa3bf57a3770e3842a0) and one evening. It's weekend-hackathon quality, but it worked!

And the results were pretty impressive.


Previously, it took 35.354 seconds per token, running one prompt.

By running 500 prompts at a time on each layer, we got down to 4.85 seconds, a 7x speedup.


More detailed benchmarks:

 * 35.354s for 1 prompt, 35.354 seconds per token
 * 40.387s for 2-prompt batch, 20.1935 seconds per token
 * 55.527s for 5-prompt batch, 11.1054 seconds per token
 * 265.9s for 50-prompt batch, 5.318 seconds per token
 * 2426.11s for 500-prompt batch, 4.85222 seconds per token


# How can the rest of us do this?

If you want to do something like this, I recommend looking into [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen), which likely does this _way_ better than my hacked AirLLM did. It even uses some slick linear programming techniques to determine the best batch sizes.


! Linear programming is different from linear types, about which I [posted another article today](/blog/higher-raii-uses-linear-types)!


On top of that, AirLLM leaves a lot of performance on the table: [#blockwise] It doesn't load the next layer ahead of time, even if there's room for it. It waits until inferencing is done. If it loaded the next layer while we did inferencing on this one, we could get those faster times (like 4.85s) on much smaller batch sizes than 500.


<slice>
#blockwise: AirLLM also has a [block-wise quantization](https://github.com/lyogavin/Anima/tree/main/air_llm#model-compression---3x-inference-speed-up) option for 3x speedup, but it doesn't work on Mac and probably won't [until bitsandbytes better supports Mac](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/1020). This looked promising for a speedup, but I actually suspect it won't help us here.

# The takeaways

Honestly, this doesn't really change anything. I just added an existing technique to an existing tool so I could do a thing on my Mac.


However, what most people don't know, and the main reason I wrote a whole post about this journey, is to show people that *normal computers can run larger LLMs with reasonable throughput* for some use cases.


This technique unblocks a lot of interesting uses, like:

 * We could periodically run a little program that looks at all new posts on r/technology, filters out anything unrelated to technology, and adds it to an RSS feed.
 * When an iOS device is plugged in at night, we could run a local AI to generate a short caption for all the pictures we took that day.
 * We could make a "weird yearly event finder" running on a Raspberry Pi at home! [# I haven't tried putting any of this on a Raspberry PI yet, but it would be pretty awesome.]

These are all latency-agnostic use cases that can use this approach, without needing hundreds or thousands of dollars of GPUs.

Hopefully, it's only a matter of time before libraries better support this use case!
